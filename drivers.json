This ensures that the system or structure is operating as intended and meets established safety goals.\n\nPrioritizing safety as an architectural driver can encourage the use of proven design patterns or best practices, which make it easier to verify that the system is functioning correctly.\n\nSafety also helps to reduce the risk of errors or failures in the system, which can make it easier to identify and diagnose any issues during the verification process. This ultimately leads to a more dependable and verifiable system."

        "description": "When architects prioritize usability as an architectural driver, they ensure that the system or product will be easy to use and understand for its intended users. This means that the system will be more accessible and transparent, making it easier for users to verify that the system is indeed meeting their needs.\n\nA usability-focused design can lead to a more intuitive and cohesive user experience, making it easier for users to identify and report any issues or inconsistencies they encounter. This enhances the system's verifiability by providing more opportunities for users to test and validate the system.\n\nBy prioritizing usability, architects can also design systems that are more consistent and predictable in their behavior, reducing the likelihood of unexpected errors or bugs. This can improve the system's verifiability by creating a more stable and reliable platform for testing and verifying its functionality."

    "description": "Verifiability is an important architecture driver that focuses on ensuring the system's ability to provide evidence or proof of correctness, compliance, or desired behavior. Verifiability architecture involves designing and implementing solutions that are verifiable through various means, such as formal methods, testing, auditing, or monitoring. It includes strategies such as code review, unit testing, integration testing, and validation against specifications or requirements to ensure that the system performs as intended and meets the desired quality standards. The goal is to establish confidence in the system's correctness, reliability, and adherence to standards or regulations. By prioritizing verifiability, organizations can mitigate risks, improve system quality, and enhance trust in the system, ultimately enabling stakeholders to have confidence in its operation and outcomes."
